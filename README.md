# Water-Potability-Prediction
This project predicts water potability using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. Features include chemical/physical properties like pH and hardness. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to ensure accurate predictions.
