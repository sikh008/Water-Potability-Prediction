# Water-Potability-Prediction
This project predicts water potability using machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest. Features include chemical/physical properties like pH and hardness. Key steps include data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to ensure accurate predictions.

## Project Structure
- `INTERNSHIP_REPORT_sikh/`: Contains the full final report.
- `body/`: Contains the main body of the report.
- `water-quality.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the machine learning model.
- `water_potability.csv`: Contains the required dataset needed for the project.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sikh008/Water-Potability-Project.git

2. Install the necessary packages:

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   jupyter notebook water-quality.ipynb
